The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, when using `calc()` with percentages, unexpected results may occur due to the order of operations.  For example, consider this code:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

If the parent element has a width of 200px, you might expect the `.element` to have a width of 90px (100px - 10px). However, the calculation might be interpreted as `(50% - 10px)`, resulting in a different width.

Another issue involves spaces around operators.  Incorrect spacing can lead to unexpected behaviour. For example:

```css
width: calc(50%  -  10px);
/* Incorrect spacing */
```

This could result in unexpected layout issues.  Always ensure there are *no* extra spaces around the operators.
