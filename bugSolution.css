To correct the unexpected behavior, ensure the order of operations is explicit using parentheses and remove any unnecessary spaces around the operators. 

For example, to ensure `50%` is calculated before the subtraction, you could rewrite the CSS like this:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

Or, to ensure no unexpected interpretation of spaces:

```css
width: calc(50% - 10px);
/* Correct spacing */
```

Thorough testing and clear use of parentheses within the `calc()` function help to prevent these unexpected behaviors.
